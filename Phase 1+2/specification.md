# Nutrition App

We propose an app that provides nutritional suggestions to a user depending on their age, sex, BMI, height, weight, and goal weight. The app produces a specific meal plan which accommodates the user's inputted weight loss/gain goal and provides various options for different food preferences while remaining below a target calory upper limit. The app uses caloric information to optimize the meal plan, giving the users a set meal plan. They can then refresh certain meals (or all the meals) if they do not like certain suggestions.

In short, the app provides interactive and live nutritional guidance to the user based on their current health status and the goal they want to achieve. Users log into the system with their individual username and password to retain this information.
