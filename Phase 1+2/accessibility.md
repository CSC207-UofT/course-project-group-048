### Equitable Use
Our product has great colour contrast in the GUI which makes it easier to read the buttons and navigate through the app for colour blind users and others with difficulty in reading. However, our app does not have audio support and it limits the use for those who are totally blind. Therefore, our app does not completely adhere to the principle of equitable use.

### Flexibility Use
Our app allows flexible use for users with different preferences and abilities. It can accommodate both right and left handed individuals as most of the clickable buttons and sections are in the center of the screen. Moreover, the clickable components are large enough facilitating users’ accuracy and precision in tapping them. 

### Simple and Intuitive Use
Our app adheres to the simple and intuitive use principle by adding hint text for each entry components such as names and age when creating the account. It helps the users to understand what they need to do. In addition, there are few buttons for simplicity, eliminating unnecessary complexity. 

### Perceptible Information
As mentioned previously, the app uses the colour contrast effectively for better legibility. However, the app is not compatible for those who are blind because it does not have the verbal mode to deliver information to them. Therefore, we could implement it in the future to communicate the information through audio with blind users. 

### Tolerance of Errors
Simple and easy to follow error messages are built in our app. For example, an error message asking to fill in the full name when the new user’s full name was not entered. The app prevents the new users from signing up when at least one of the sections is not filled. It prevents further errors when using the app. The meal generator prevents excessive/insufficient amounts of meals when the wrong information(weight/dietary goal) is filled in.

### Low Physical Effort
The app requires minimal physical effort because there is minimal typing in the app such as filling required information. Although, the app is only compatible with smartphones with android operating system. Using smartphones might not be the best in maintaining neutral posture. Making the app compatible with desktops/laptops better adheres to low physical effort principle in the future. 

### Size and Space for Approach
Size of the buttons and the effective use makes the app adhere to the principle. Most of the interactive components are placed in the center of the screen, they are in reasonable size so that users with any finger sizes can tap with accuracy, and the app can be used at any position. The interactive components are sized and separated appropriately for approach and manipulation.

Our group developed an android app that generates meal plans for those who are willing to gain/lose weight. The app can provide user specific meal plans based on their weight goals and current diet. Therefore, we would market the app to those who are looking for dietary support or resources when they are trying to gain/lose weight. More specifically,  we would market towards individuals older than 14 years old regardless of gender. Those who are new to dietary change might not be aware of where to start if they do not receive support from professional dietitians. Therefore, the app provides some advice on how to reach their goals by generating meals to the users. In addition, we can market the app towards those who are looking for meal ideas. The app contains several healthy meal ingredients which can provide meal ideas to the users.

Children below 14 are less likely to be using our app because they usually do not need to control/manipulate their weight. Competitive athletes might not use this app because they are likely receiving the support from the professionals when controlling their body composition. Our app does not take vitamin and mineral content into account and it is crucial for athletes. Furthermore, those who are not willing to change their weight might not be interested in using our app.
