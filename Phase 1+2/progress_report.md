### Member Contribution and Future Plans

Aryamann worked on developing the database so that the program could store and load state. He was a great problem-solver, working on various facets of the code to test and debug. Some of his work included bugs with the database, the meal generator, and the login system. 

Paula worked on our testing strategy with Android Test which was crucial in the development of our program. She made sure we respected the Universal Design Principles, created our CRC model, and created the design for the Progress page of our app (which we removed due to scope).

Will worked on the main functionality of the program, including intense refactoring of existing code, creation of the Meal Generator page, creation of the Profile page, Android Test, database management, the design document, packaging, architecture, SOLID, and problem-solving with Aryamann.

Ram worked on the main functionality of the program, including creation of the initial Android Development Environment in Android Studio, development of all front-end XML files, creation of driver classes, incorporation SOLID design principles, avoidance of code smells, and communication with the group.

Harsh worked on code organization and style. He spent hours creating JavaDocs for many of the functions in the program.

### What Has Worked Well

Our teamwork to debug various issues with the code was spectacular. Although it would have been nicer to have a larger group, we found it easier to communicate with a smaller group. As stated in the design document, we all enjoyed working on this project and look forward to future development of the code.
