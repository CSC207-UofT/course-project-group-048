# Nutrition App Specification
We propose an app that provides nutritional suggestions to a user depending on their age, sex, BMI, height, weight, and goal weight over a certain time frame. The app produces a specific meal plan which accommodates the user's inputted goals and provides various options for different food preferences while still reaching nutritional goals. The app uses web scraping to gather comprehensive nutritional facts and optimize the meal plan, giving the users a food journal to keep record of their diet and its breakdown.

The app also provides the user with an option to input their daily meals and gives a progressive report on their health. This tracks and compares the user's progress to their set health goals and suggests the appropriate course of future action based on their current health status. In short, the app provides interactive and live nutritional guidance to the user based on their current health status and the goal they want to achieve. Users log into the system with their individual username and password to retain their information.
